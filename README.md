# 1U Reaction Wheels Hardware

This repository contains folders for the hardware involved in the 1U reaction wheels test stand. Make new folders for all new designs.

### Current Hardware

- The folder "Reaction Wheels Template" contains a template with the connectors and board layout that are to be used for PCBs involved in the 1U reaction wheels test stand. You should be able to make a copy to start a new design. We are not currently using this template.

- The folder "Quad_Motor_Driver" contains a PCB for driving our four reaction wheels.
